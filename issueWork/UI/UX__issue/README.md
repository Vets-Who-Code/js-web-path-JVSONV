# UI / UX issue  

## Changes made:  

> 1. Complete overhall of webpage layout based on previously received feedback. Essentially creating a clean and somewhat minimal style.
 - ### Laws:  
   - **Aesthetic-Usability**
   - **Jakob's Law**
   - **Hick's Law**
> 2. Attached and created an accordin to the hero section's breif about me. Which when clicked expands to a larger more indepth about me section.  
 - ### Laws:  
   - **Law of Proximity**
   - **Doherty Threshold (currently 300ms)**
   - **Law of Common Region**

> 3. Created a Projects section. Currently grouping three mock projects with title, description, and what poblem it solved. May introduce languages and technology used to create project. This is dependant on feedback received.  
 -  ### Laws:    
    - **Law of Similarity**
    - **Tesler's Law**

> 4. Though not completed the contact form with be a modal with only 3 inputs. 
 - ### Law:  
   - **Postel's Law**

> 5.  In the final implementation the nav will be affixed to the top of the page. Idea here is to utilize Miller's Law in a way that the viewer is only seeing the nav and three projects. This way upon review of projects the contact me button is not out of sight.
