# UI / UX issue

## Changes made:

> 1. Complete overhaul of webpage layout based on previously received feedback. Creating a clean and somewhat minimal style.

- ### Laws:
  - **Aesthetic-Usability**
  - **Jakob's Law**
  - **Hick's Law**
    > 2. I attached and created an accordion dropdown to the hero section's brief about me. Which, when clicked, expands to a larger, more in-depth about me section.
- ### Laws:
  - **Law of Proximity**
  - **Doherty Threshold (currently 300ms)**
  - **Law of Common Region**

> 3. Added a Project section. Currently grouping three mock projects with title, description, and what problem it solved. May introduce languages and technology used to create a project. This is dependent on the feedback received.

- ### Laws:
  - **Law of Similarity**
  - **Tesler's Law**

> 4. Though not complete, the contact form with be a modal with only three inputs.

- ### Law:
  - **Postel's Law**

> 5.  In the final implementation, the nav will be affixed to the top of the page. The idea here is to utilize Miller's Law so that the viewer only sees the nav and three projects. This way, upon review of projects, the contact me button is in sight.
